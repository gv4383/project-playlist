# Sound Skwerl

Welcome to Sound Skwerl, the latest, but not so greatest playlist web app! The purpose of this project was to create a simple, full-stack web application that allows users to search for songs and add them to custom-made playlists.

## Before Getting Started

This application is currently designed for mobile view ONLY. In order to view this web application properly, kindly open up the developer tools tab and change the responsive view to "Pixel 2".

Updates to make the web application fully responsive for ALL views are coming soon. Please be patient and I deeply apologize for any inconveniences this may bring.

## Getting Started

Before you start using this web app, you'll have to have a valid Spotify account nad login with it. The spotify account can be the free version, or the premium version.

## Application Walkthrough

### Searching And Adding Songs

Once logged in, you should be taken to the search page where you can search for any song within Spotify's music library. Go ahead and sample as many songs as you like!

When you have found a song you would like to add to a playlist, simply select which playlist you would like to add it to by clicking the dropdown button under each song. Clicking this button should show all of your current playlists and will update when playlists are created/deleted. Once you have selected the playlist you would like to add the song to, click the "ADD" button to add it.

### Playlist Management

Before you can add a song to a playlist, you'll have to create a playlist. Click the menu button in the top right of the screen and click "PLAYLISTS". All of your playlists should appear on this page. To create a playlist, simply input a name and a description for your new playlist and click the "ADD PLAYLIST" button to create it.

At this point, you should see your playlist's name, description, and two buttons at the bottom of your playlist card. The "EDIT" button allows you to edit the description of the playlist, while the "DELETE" button deletes the playlist entirely.

### Selecting An Individual Playlist

When a specific playlist is clicked, you'll be shown all of the songs that you have added to it. Here you can listen to these specific songs and even remove songs from the playlist by clicking the red "X" button to the right of the song.

### User Page

The user page contains your Spotify account info, such as your username, profile avatar, email, and the country associated with your Spotify account.
